## Project Overview    
### Nearly 700,000 people left California last year
#### Despite roughly 500,000 people coming to the Golden State in 2018, census data shows more people left California than moved in.
CALIFORNIA, USA — In 2018, nearly 700,000 people decided to pack their bags and leave the California life behind.

**By contrast, there were only 501,000 people who decided to follow the California dream and set up camp in the state. With 691,000 people leaving the Golden State for another state, California was in the negative as far as net population change.**

The exodus from California also led among other states. Only the numbers for Texas, Florida, and New York came close.

**Texas lost 462,000; New York lost 458,000; and Florida lost 470,000.**

According to [the Census data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/state-to-state-migration.html), most Californians found themselves heading to Texas, Arizona, Washington, Nevada, and Oregon.  
- Texas - 86,000
- Arizona - 68,000
- Washington - 55,000
- Nevada - 50,000
- Oregon - 43,000  

While California led in people leaving the state in 2018, it came in third for the number of people who moved in. The state was behind Florida, who had 587,000, and Texas, who saw 563,000 move in.

**Census data also showed that the number of people leaving California has steadily increased since 2011.**  
- 2018 - 691,000
- 2017 - 661,000
- 2016 - 657,000
- 2015 - 643,000
- 2014 - 593,000
- 2013 - 581,000
- 2012 - 566,000
- 2011 - 562,000  

A [2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265) revealed that more than a million people left California - spread out over a decade - as opposed to those who moved here from other states.  

The study said high taxes, cost of living, and affordable housing were among the main reasons why people were leaving.  

A [recent study by UC Berkeley](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/96j2704t) made similar findings with voters. According to the poll, roughly half of the state's voters have considered leaving California.  

The main reason was the high cost of housing, but high taxes and political culture were also big reasons voters considered leaving.

**Reason the topic was selected**  
There are many articles written, like this one, about Califorian's leaving due to the high cost of living. The reason this topic was selected, with our group living in California, it's personal.  

As a broad generalization, most people can afford to purchase a house worth about three times their total (gross) annual income, assuming a 20% down payment and a moderate amount of other long-term debts, such as car or student loan payments. This best practice can be found at [mymoneyblog.com](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/4-different-rules-of-thumb-for-how-much-house-you-can-afford.html). As there are many similar "Best Practices" in home buying, We would like to keep a consistancy throughout the analysis and use this one, three times total annual income. The consistancy will make the analysis meaningful. 

With the best pracice in mind and the median price of homes currently listed in San Bernardino County is $350,000, according to [zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/san-bernardino-county-ca/home-values/), a single gross income of **$116,666.67** would be needed to purchase a **median price** home in **San Bernardino County**.  

Although, that number is flabbergasting enough, it fails when compared to surrounding California counties.These counties the median home prices are, easily, doubled.  Meaning, the gross annual income would, also, have to double.

**Description of the source of data**  
All .csv resources for our analysis were downloaded from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)

**Questions the team hopes to answer with the data**  
We would like to perform analysis on the cost of housing in California that included:  

- Median Home Price
- Median Household Income  
  
With California being the targeted data, we wanted to compare all the other states. Questions the team hopes to answer with the data is:  
- What are the California median household prices in California expected to be in the next five years?  
- What are the California median household prices in California expected to be in the next ten years?  
- Based on the ["Best Practices"](https://www.mymoneyblog.com/4-different-rules-of-thumb-for-how-much-house-you-can-afford.html) in home buying, how much income would be needed to live in a median priced home in California at that time.  
- What are the top 5 states Californians are moving to?  
- How does California housing cost compare to those 5 states?

After our analysis, we hope to answer:
- Is it time to leave California?

## Communication Protocols  
It is important to establish a communication protocol. We created direct messages for only team members in Slack at [final-project-jas](https://ucbdatasept19.slack.com/archives/CTXNA5K5G) and exchanged cell phone numbers where we created a group-text.  

- Instant commumnication will be done via text  
- Ideas and links will be done via Slack  
- Meetups will be held via Zoom  

In an emergency we will inform our group through our group-text and reach out to the staff by direct conversation in Slack.
