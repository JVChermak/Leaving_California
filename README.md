## Project Roadmap  
The project roadmap and description of all the project deliverables can be found in [Deliverables.md](/Deliverables.md)  

## Project Overview  
**Reason the topic was selected**   
**Questions the team hopes to answer with the data**  
**Description of the source of data**

## Resources
- **Data Source:** [data](), [data](), [data]()
- **Software:** Jupyter Notebook, PostgreSQL  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Dependencies:** Pandas  
- **Algorithms:**  

## Objectives   
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.
- Select, design, and train a binary classification model of our choosing.
- Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.

## Summary  
**Description of the data exploration phase of the project**  
- Description of data preprocessing
- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team’s decision-making process  
**Description of the analysis phase of the project**  
- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets  
- Description of how the model was trained (or retrained if the team used an existing model)
- Description and explanation of model’s confusion matrix, including final accuracy score    
**Result of analysis**  
- How does the model address the question or problem the team is solving.  

## Recommendation
**Recommendation for future analysis**   

## Limitations  
**Anything the team would have done differently**  
- models benifits 
- models limitations  
## Communication Protocols  
It is important to establish a communication protocol. We created direct messages for only team members in Slack at [final-project-jas](https://ucbdatasept19.slack.com/archives/CTXNA5K5G) and exchanged cell phone numbers where we created a group-text.  

- Instant commumnication will be done via text  
- Ideas and links will be done via Slack  
- Meetups will be held via Zoom  

In an emergency we will inform our group through our group-text and reach out to the staff by direct conversation in Slack.
